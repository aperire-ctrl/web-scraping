    Please create a personal web page at http://walrus.uccs.edu/~<login>/cs526/ with your personal photo, basic vita,  your interests in this class,  and potential semester projects that you may work on.  This will allow classmates to find common interests and know each other. See http://cs.uccs.edu/~cs301/graphics/scanning.htm for scanning your personal photo.  You can also use my personal web page as a template. If you do not know how to setup your personal web page, drop by my office.  I will help you.  This is part of your hw#1.
    Make sure you use <login>.jpg for your photo image file.  Check on a browser and see if you can access your web page.  If you got "forbidden" msg, it means that you need to open the access rights of your home directory and public_html directory.  Use "chmod 755 ../<login>" and "chmod 755 public_html" commands for changing the access rights.

    CS526 mailing list:  We established a netowrk alias cs526-l@uccs.edu that can be considered as group mailing address or a distribution list.  You can email to the whole class using this email address.  Only email sent from the group members are allowed to be forwarded. To forward the email to your own server,  you need to
        either set up a .forward file which contains the email address with your default mail server by login to brain.uccs.edu with your computing service account and create a .forward file with the email address of your regular mail server,  or
        configure your mail program or your default mail server to read mails from POP (post office protocol) server of uccs.edu.
